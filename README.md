YouTube Companion Dashboard
Task
Build a mini-dashboard that connects to the YouTube API and helps users manage one of their uploaded videos in detail:

Upload an unlisted video to YouTube directly (not via API).

On your app's home page, show details about your uploaded video by fetching via API.

Add an option to comment on the video and reply to any comment.

Add an option to change the title and description of the video.

Allow the user to delete their comment as well.

Add a notes section (stored in your DB) where the user can jot down ideas for improving the video.

Add a basic search or tagging feature to quickly find notes later.

Requirements
Capture all event logs and store them into a database of your choice.

In your README file, list down your API endpoints as well as your database schema.

Deploy the API + UI online. You can use Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, Heroku, Render, etc.
